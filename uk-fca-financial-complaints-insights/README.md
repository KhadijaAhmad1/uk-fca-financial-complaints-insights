# UK Financial Complaints Insights: Identifying Consumer Harm Trends Using FCA Data

## Overview
This project analyses publicly available UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) complaints data to identify trends, concentration areas, and potential indicators of emerging consumer harm. The objective is to translate regulatory data into clear, actionable insights that can support decision-making by financial institutions, regulators, and policy stakeholders.

## Problem Statement
Financial complaints data is often published in raw tabular form, making it difficult to quickly identify where consumer harm may be increasing or which product areas require attention. This project addresses that gap by structuring, analysing, and visualising complaints data to surface meaningful patterns and risks.

## Data Source
- UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – Firm-level and product-level complaints data  
- Data is publicly available and used solely for analytical and educational purposes.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and standardisation
- Aggregation by product category, complaint type, and time period
- Trend and year-on-year growth analysis
- Concentration analysis to identify high-impact product areas
- Visualisation through an executive-style dashboard

## Key Insights
- See `report/key_insights.md` for detailed findings.

## Outputs
- Clean, analysis-ready dataset
- Interactive dashboard highlighting complaint trends and hotspots
- One-page insight brief summarising findings and implications

## Limitations
- Analysis is limited to published FCA complaint data and does not include customer-level detail.
- Complaint volumes do not directly equate to confirmed misconduct.
- Normalisation by customer base is constrained by publicly available information.

## Next Steps
- Introduce early-warning indicators for complaint spikes
- Add time-series forecasting to anticipate emerging risk areas
- Extend analysis with additional regulatory or economic datasets
